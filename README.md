# MicroSwarmOS
MicroSwarmOS ("micro‑swarm" operating system) is a microVM‑oriented, multi‑kernel OS designed for extreme minimalism and resilience.  It combines concepts from microvirtual machines, multikernel research, immutable filesystems and self‑healing infrastructure to create a platform suitable for enterprise deployment via Docker or Kubernetes.
